            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And now I come to shew how that the Kings and Rulers of the earth, who forſake the onely true God to ſerve ſtrange gods, were the onely and chief Ring-leaders of the people from the true God and his way

            <p>And now I will lay down the particular things, to shew wherein the Kings and Rulers of the earth have acted in their own wills by their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, to do thoſe things for the worship of their falſe gods, which things that by them done were ſin, and what things they are doing for a falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping of the onely true God, which is ſin, and ſuch as God never requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at their hands.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, The building and repairing of the Houſes of High Places,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Kings</hi> 17.12, 15. <hi>Jer.</hi> 19.5. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.31, 32.</note> (called <hi>Churches</hi>) for the worshipping of their falſe gods in, or otherwayes for a pretence of worshipping the true God, which thing God never requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at their hands to do; <hi>For God dwells not in Temples made with hands, nor is he worshipped in Temples made with hands, but he is to be worshipped in ſpirit and in truth, and ſuch worshippers the Father looks for, &amp; dmells with him that is of an humble &amp; contrite ſpirit, Ioh.</hi> 4.20, 21, 22, 23, 24. <hi>Acts</hi> 7.47, 48, 49. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, Their conſecrating and making Prieſts to offer up Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to preach in thoſe Hgh Places, called <hi>Churches,</hi> for money and tythes, is a thing that God never required at their hands to do, and therefore it is a ſin for them ſo to do, 1 <hi>K ngs</hi> 13.33, 34. <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.37, 38.</p>
            <p>The third is, the Laws that the Kings and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hipped in ſpirit and in truth. And now I will compare thoſe houſes of high places which <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam, Ahab, Manaſſeh,</hi> and the heathens made, with thoſe that we have in <hi>England,</hi> which are falſly called Churches, and ſee how far ſhort they have fallen, and how far they do now fall ſhort of being the ſame, or ſuch like as they were.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The founders or builders of thoſe houſes of high places that the Scripture ſpeak of, that I have before mentioned were built up by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and idolatrous people, at the command of the wicked and ungodly Kings and Rulers of the Earth, ſuch as <hi>Jeroboam, Rehoboam, Ahab,</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh</hi> were, and now by hypocritical Kings and Rulers, and idolatrous Kings are upheld and maintained.</p>
            <p>So theſe that we have here in England, were all of them built up by the popiſh Saxon Kings, and other Idolaters; I will onely inſtance ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of them, as I ſound them written in our Engliſh Hiſtories. About the year 604. by two of the Saxon Kings, <hi>viz.

            <p>And in the year 636.

               <hi>Atholſtone,</hi> (the <hi>Cornish</hi> being ſubdued) returned to the City which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently was called <hi>Monbeton,</hi> but now <hi>Exceter,</hi> and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hip Images in; and the Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Kings and others built Monaſteries, Abbies, Nunneries, Chantry-houſes, and Fryer-houſes, for their Monks, Nunnes, Prieſts, Fryars, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots. And thus the founders or builders of your falſe Churches were I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters, as thoſe were ſpoken of in the Scriptures, and it was one and the ſame Spirit of Error and Witchcraft that guided them to do them in rebellion againſt God, for God never required it at their hands to do, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.12.15. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.31. &amp; 19.5.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:118899:9"/>
            <p>Secondly, The Houſes of high places that the heathen and the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Kings of Iſrael built up, were built ſo large for height, length, and breadth, and ſo ſtrange withall,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iudges</hi> 16. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.</note> that they did contain and hold thouſands of people; for the Houſe that <hi>Dagon</hi> the god of the <hi>Philiſtine</hi> ſtood in, was ſo large, that it held about three thouſand men and women upon the Roof, and the Houſe was full of men and women, and the Lords of the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines were there: <hi>And</hi> Jehu <hi>he proclaimed a ſolemn aſſembly for Baal,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.22.</note> 
               <hi>and</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu <hi>ſent through all Iſrael, and called for all the Prophets of Baal, and all his ſervants, and all the Prieſts of Baal, and all the worshippers of Baal, and they came all into the Houſe of Baal, and the Houſe of Baal was filled from one end to another:</hi> Now the prophets of <hi>Baal</hi> was in the dayes of <hi>Ahab</hi> four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty men, and ſure his prieſts, and his ſervants, and his worſhippers were many more; for the Houſe was filled with them from one end to the other, as ſaith the Scripture.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe the Houſes of high places here in <hi>England,</hi> which are falſly called <hi>Churches,</hi> are for height, length, and breadth builded ſo ſtrong, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Cathedrals, and ſome of the others, that above in their Galleries and below, they will hold thouſands of men, yea, and the Princes, and the Rulers, and the Nobles, and the Judges, and the Prieſts that preach in them for hire, and the Prophets that ſtudy or divine for money, all in a Pariſh will but ſcarce fill them up from one end to the other, and another to help them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Houſes of high places that <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and <hi>Ahab</hi> built, they had Veſtries, and Veſtments belonging to them, and likewiſe they had men that had the charge over them; take one for a pattern of all the reſt;<note place="margin">2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </note> 
               <hi>And Jehu ſaid unto him that was over the Veſtry, Bring forth Veſtments for all the worshippers of Baal, and he brought them forth Veſtments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So likewiſe the Houſes of high places, falſly called <hi>Churches,</hi> here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> they have men appointed to take the charge of them and their Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtries too, who are called by the Name of <hi>Churchwardens, Veſtry-men, Clarks</hi> and <hi>Sexſtones;</hi> and theſe, with Prieſts and the Veſtry-men, are the Rulers of their falſe Church, which is but a houſe of high places: For firſt, at the end, or in the middle of ſome, there is a high place called the Steeple, where the formerly chriſtened Bells hang; and that place is a high place for pleaſure, and a place for profit by their ringing of their Bells, for when that one is dead they mourn, and ring Bells, and get money; and when one is marryed, they ring the Bells, and rejoice, and get money in the high place; and formerly the Bells was wont to be rung to keep evil ſpirits and tempeſts from their Towns; and when that the Pope or Biſhop cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſt any for a ſin, as they called it, they uſed to curſe them with Bell, Book, and Candle, then the Bells was rung, that all might know that a he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>etick, or ſome ſuch like, was curſt at high Altar: So with the Bells they bleſs, and with the Bells they curſe; with the Bells they weep, and with the Bells they rejoice; with the Bells they take pleaſure, and with the Bells they got money; and with the Bells they uſed to call people to worſhip Images, and now with the Bells the people are called together to worſhip a god a far off that they know not; and at the ringing the bells the prieſts make themſelves ready to go p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>each for their hire, who has the chiefeſt place in their Church, ſo called, <hi>viz</hi> the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:118899:10"/> and then there is a high place at the other end, called the Chancel, and high places of each ſide, called the Iles; and a high place called the Veſtry in ſome, where formerly the prieſts Veſtments, and Robes, and other trinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its formerly lay in: and then a high place in the middle, called the body of the Church. And thus I have ſhewed wherein and how they are called hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of high places, and I deny them to be Churches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly: In the houſes of hlgh places that the heathens and the idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Kings of Iſrael and Judah built, there was pictures, images, or the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of creatures made and ſet up in them to be worſhipped as gods, which were not God, but Idols, the workmanſhip of mens hands; for <hi>Jeroboam</hi> he made in likeneſs two Calves of gold, and the one he ſet up at the City cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Dan,</hi> and thither the people went to worſhip; and the other he ſet up at <hi>Bethel;</hi> and <hi>Jeroboam</hi> ſaid unto the people, <hi>Theſe are thy gods O Iſrael, that brought thee up out of Aegypt:</hi>

And the god that <hi>Ahab</hi> ſerved was <hi>Baal,</hi> which was ſet up in the houſe at <hi>Samaria,</hi> which <hi>Ahab</hi> built for <hi>Baal:</hi> and <hi>Baal</hi> is taken for <hi>Ashteroth,</hi> the Idol of the <hi>Zidonians,</hi> which <hi>Jezabel</hi> cauſed to be worſhipped:<note place="margin">2 <hi>King.</hi> 10.18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 16.31, 32. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 16.</note> and <hi>Baal</hi> was made in the likeneſs of a Ewe, or a Sheep; read I ſay your Marginal notes of your great Bibles, upon the ſecond chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Judges,</hi> verſe 13. And <hi>Micah</hi> the man of Mount <hi>Ephraim</hi> he had two Images made of Silver, a graven Image, and a Moulten Image, and they were ſet up in the Houſe of <hi>Micah,</hi> for <hi>Micah</hi> had a Houſe of gods, and he made an Ephod and a Teraphim. Now all theſe gold and ſilver gods were the workmanſhip of mens hands, which the Carpenter, the Founder, the Graver formed and faſhioned in the likeneſs of the creature, the which do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was forbidden of God,<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>And now I come to ſhew what manner of Pictures and Images we had, and now have in our high places, falſly called Churches, here in <hi>England:</hi> Firſt, There was a Picture called the Rood of Grace, that was ſwayed up in a place called the Rood Loft, and hung upon ſhrines, which the people (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeduced) were led aſide to worſhip; for I will inſtance two or three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Roods, that the Reader may know what they were.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118899:10"/> of <hi>Dover</hi> Court, unto which the people did much reſort, becauſe a rumor was ſpread abroad among the people, That the power of the Rood of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> Court was ſo great, that no man had power to ſhut the Church door (ſo called) where he ſtood, therefore ſaid they, The door is fain to ſtand open night and day: Whereupon one <hi>Robert King,</hi> and <hi>Nicholas Marsh</hi> of <hi>Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and one <hi>Robert Debnam</hi> of <hi>Eſtborgholt,</hi> being moved by the ſpirit of the Lord, did (like <hi>Gideon</hi>) go in the night ten Miles, and found the door of their Church open, as was reported, &amp; they took down the Rood from his ſhrine, and carryed him about a quarter of a mile from his place where he ſtood, and ſtroke fire with a Steel and a Flint, and ſet fire to the Rood, and burnt him; for the which good act doing, they all three good honeſt men did ſuffer death by hanging in Chains.

            <p>Fifthly: In the Houſes of high places that the Heathen and the Idolatrous Kings of Judah and Iſrael built, they made Altars and reared up in them: <hi>Ahab</hi> he reared up an Altar in the Houſe of <hi>Baal;</hi>

               </gap>y-Houſes, and Colledges: Now the firſt beginning of any reformation that I find of the Idolatry that they had ſet up, was in the dayes of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, wherein a Parliament was called, &amp; it was enacted and decreed, That in cauſes and matters happening in contention, no perſon ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, provoke, or ſue out of the Kings Dominions, to the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> Secondly, It was deſigned and concluded, That all exportation of Anuities &amp; firſt Fruits out of this Realm to the See of <hi>Rome</hi> for any Bulls, Breefes, or Palles, or expedition of any ſuch thing, ſhould utterly ceaſe. Thirdly, It was enacted, That the Pope &amp; all his Colledge of Cardinals, with his Pardons and Indulgences, which had ſo long clogged this Realm of <hi>England,</hi> to the miſerable ſlaughter of ſo many good men (and which never could be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved before) was now aboliſhed, eradicate, and exploded out of this Land, and ſent home to their own country from whence they came; and what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation was this? none at all: for all this which they took away from the Pope, in a manner was ſetled upon King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. For firſt, they made
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:118899:13"/> him Head of the <hi>Church,</hi> as they called it, inſtead of the Pope: Their words of the Act are as followeth: <hi>Be it enacted by this preſent Parliament, That the King our Soveraign Lord, his Heirs and Succeſſors, Kings of this Realm, shall be taken, accepted, and reputed the onely ſupreme Head (in Earth) of the Church of</hi> ENGLAND, <hi>ſo called, Anglicanâ Eccleſia.

Thirdly, And that our ſaid Soveraign Lord, his Heirs and Succeſſors, Kings of this Realm, shall have full Power and Authority from time to time, to viſite, repreſs, redreſs, reform, order, correct, reſtrain and amend all ſuch errors, abuſes, offences, contempts, and enormities whatſoever they be, which by any manner of ſpiritual Authority or Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction ought, or may lawfully be reformed, repreſſed, ordered, redreſſed, corrected, reſtrained, or amended; any uſage, cuſtome, forraign Laws, forraign Authority, Preſcription, or any thing or things to the contrary hereof notwithſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for my part I ſee that none of the poor common people were ever the more eaſed of their burdens, (onely the King and the Biſhops, with the reſt of the Clergy) except their paying of <hi>Peter-Pence</hi> to the Pope, and that was none at all, becauſe now the Prieſts have a Penny for the ſmoke of every Chimney, as the Pope had: Now ſee where the reformation was, firſt, That a Bible of the largeſt Volume, and in <hi>English,</hi> be provided, and ſet up in ſome convenient place of every Church, as they called it. Secondly, The <hi>Pater-Noſter</hi> was to be in <hi>English.</hi> Thirdly, Sermons was to be made quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly. Fourthly, Such feigned Images (but not all) which were abuſed by Pilgrimage and Offerings, were to be taken down without delay. Fifthly, <hi>Tho. Bockets</hi> day was forbidden to be obſerved, but no other. And ſixthly, The knoling of <hi>Aves</hi> was forbidden, leſt the people ſhould hereafter truſt to have pardon from the Pope for the ſaying of <hi>Aves</hi> between the ſaid kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as they have done in times paſt. Seventhly, The Abbies, Monaſteries, Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar-Houſes, were many of them pulled down &amp; deſtroyed. And eighthly, The Abbots, the Monks, the Fryars were ſuppreſſed; but the Popiſh Biſhops, <hi>viz.</hi> Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, and Prieſts, were upheld ſtil, &amp; maintained by their goodly Lordſhips: Glebe-Lands, Rectories, and Tythes, as well as when the Pope was the Head of the Church, and men and women were burned for Hereticks, as they called them, then, as they were when the Pope was Head of the Church, ſo called: And <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and the Communion in both kinds: and Vows of Chaſtity: and the forbidding of Prieſts marriage: and private Maſſe: and Auricular Confeſſion: and all Images, which ſerved for no other uſe but as Books for unlearned men that can no Letters, to be admoniſhed by them, as they ſaid: All ſuch ſtuffe was left, with the High Places, falſly called <hi>Churches,</hi> ſtanding without any ſcruple at all.</p>
            <p>And again, in the dayes of King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixt many, or very near all the aforeſaid ſtuffe was laid aſide, onely the Houſes of High Places, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Arch-biſhops, Parſons, Vicars, Curates, their great Lordſhips, Recto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Parſonages, Glebe-lands, Tythes, firſt fruits, and all theſe remained ſtill unpull'd down: But when Queen <hi>Mary</hi> came to the Crown, and ruled, then all that her Father and Brother had reformed, ſhe ſet up again, [except
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:118899:13" rendition="simple:additions"/> Abbies, Monaſteries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] and fell to burning of men and women for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring againſt her and her Biſhops, and the Clargies, and the peoples abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, according to the meaſure of light by them received, faſter then all the Kings that were before her. And Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> ſhe and her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and Parliament, reformed many things, that the others ſet up in the high places, and otherwayes; but ſtill they left the Arch-biſhops, Biſhops, their great Lordſhips, and the Glebe-Lands, the Rectories, and the Parſonages. the firſt Fruits, Tythes, and the Houſes of High Places ſtanding for to be maintained ſtill.</p>
            <p>But then in the dayes of the late King, the biſhops and the Clergy by his Authority had got an encreaſe into their High places of their Organs, their Rails, their Altars, Organiſts, and Que<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So by theſe Names and Titles ye may ſee what the founders were, and what their religion was; and now you ſhall ſee hereafter by the practiſe that is in theſe colledges, that the great and wiſe men of the world ſo highly eſteem of for their works ſake, are: But firſt, you ſhall ſee what the learned themſelves have writ of them: <hi>Wickliffe</hi> terms the Vniverſities to be the Synagogue of Satan: and <hi>John Hus.</hi> called them Lievetenants of Antichriſt: And <hi>Luther</hi> called them the Gates of Hell, the Stews of Antichriſt, Houſes of Lyes; for ſaid he,<note place="margin">TINDALL <hi>in his Book of</hi> The Revelation of ANTICHRIST.</note> 
               <hi>They are all Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical by their School-Divinity, and they are Dens of Thieves,</hi> ſaid he: And <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi> ſaid, <hi>That whoſoever ordained Vniverſities, be it</hi> Alexander <hi>at</hi> Halis: St. <hi>Thomas, or any other, he was a ſtar that fell from Heaven to the earth, for there are brought in</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>moral vertues for faith and opinions for truth;</hi> and ſaid he, <hi>The Vniverſities are the very confuſed Cloud and opened Gate of Hell;</hi> and, ſaid he, <hi>This Cloak</hi> [meaning the Vniverſities] <hi>is of all other moſt noyſome, and doth moſt hurt and damage;</hi> for ſaid he, <hi>All moral Divines have a wicked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, full of ſcrupuloſity.</hi> And <hi>Will Dell</hi> ſayes, <hi>That yet the Vniverſities are the ſtrongeſt holds that Antichrist hath had amongſt us:</hi> So that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their reformation in their Religion, the Vniverſities remain in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as bad as they were. Now for their works; firſt, When any Schollar comes to any of theſe colledges, he is examined of his <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongues; and if he be a good ſchollar, and perfect in his anſwers, he is approved of, and when he has got him a Gown and a pair of Cuffs, he is admitted into the colledge to be a Student, and if he be a great mans ſon, or one that can make great friends to the Vice-chancellor, or the head-man of an Houſe, then he gets the greater place in the colledge: but if he be a poor young man and of mean parentage, then a mean place muſt ſerve his turn: So that in their Fountains of learning to be <hi>Miniſters</hi> is reſpecting of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: for there is ſaying to the rich, <hi>Sit,</hi> or <hi>be thou here:</hi> and to the poor, Be thou in one of the meaneſt places: And then they are ſet to ſtudy Logick [that is, the Art of Reaſon.] Philoſoyhy [that is, ſtudying for Wiſdom.] And there they read <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plato's</hi> Works, and others, that they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come able diſputants, that they may diſpute at Schools, and make Theams and Verſes: And in that time called Lent, one colledge diſputes againſt another: Now do but obſerve a little of their behaviour and carriage in that time of their diſputations: Thoſe colledges who are to diſpute one againſt another, makes choice of one amongſt themſelves in each colledge to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, that by their diſputations it may be ſeen which is the greateſt ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: And he that they have made choice of to diſpute, they take him up upon their ſhoulders, &amp; carry him out of the ſchool: and in the time of their diſputing there is ſuch hiſſing and ſhouting, like a company of Gameſters at play, and when they cannot get maſtery with their tongues by diſputing, then they fall together a fighting for maſtery, and teares the Gowns from one
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:118899:19"/> anothers backs; and loſe their hats, and beats one another along the ſtreets, and ſome of them go away with black eyes. And at the end of four years, if any Schollar is judged fit in ſchollarſhip, he is to take a Degree, and then he muſt go about the city from colledge to colledge bare-headed, with a ſquare cap in his hand, and a Hood upon his ſhoulders made of Lambs Skins with the Wool on it, which they call Viſiting, to beg a Grace; and if none have any thing againſt him, then he takes a Degree of <hi>Batcheller of Arts;</hi> and when he hath taken that Degree, he may chooſe whether he will be a Divine, or a Lawyer, or a Phyſician, or an Aſtrologer; that Art which he chooſeth to be of, he furniſhes his ſtudy with Books accordingly; and ſo to ſtudy three yeers more; ſo that four years and three yeers is ſeven yeers, the time of an Apprentiſhip, unleſſe that any be favoured by the Vice-Chancellor, who gives a yeer and ſeveral graces to the party favoured; and then in the time of Lent he is to diſpute for his Degree of Maſter of Arts; and then at that time he takes his Degree of Maſter of Arts; and then he changes his Hood, and wears a ſilk one, and changes his Gown, and wears a pair of Colloſhooes on his feet, and then he gives money and rich Gloves to the Vice-Chancellor, and to ſeveral Doctors, Proctors, and to the Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles that goes before them with a ſilver tipt Staffe from place to place, and then a great Feaſt is made in the Colledge-Hall, and there they have their Wine and Muſick. And then the next Degree he takes is Batcheller of Divinity, and after Doctor of Divinity; and now take notice, That when any comes to take his Degree of Doctor of Divinity, that ſeveral Doctors kneels down to the Vice-Chancellor to beg a Grace for the Doctor that is to proceed, and when the Vice-Chancellor hath granted him to be created a Doctor, then he riſeth up, and kiſſeth the Vice-Chancellors cheek, and this is called the Doctoral kiſſe, and then is given a Doctoral Ring, Gloves, and a Doctoral Dinner, and Muſick; and at their publike commencement or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of their Degrees, they all meet together in one of the Houſes of high places, falſly called St. <hi>Maryes</hi> Church, (or other) and there is great Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds built up, and there all round the high place ſit all ſorts of people, men and women, and in the middle ſtands a place ſomewhat like a Pulpit, and in that ſtands ſome one notable Varlot, who they count a brave Schollar, who is choſen out of the Vniverſity, and he is called a <hi>Prevaricator,</hi> or a <hi>Terryfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> and he ſtands up in the middle and preſence of the Vice-chancellor, the Doctors, Heads, Students, Schollars, and all the great reſort of Miniſters and people f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now in the time of theſe ſeven yeers they have ſeveral titles given, <hi>viz.</hi> Servitors, Vndergreagates, Divines, Students, Batcheller of Art, Maſter of Art; Batcheller of Divinity, and Maſter of Divinity, Doctor of Divinity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in theſe Vniverſities they ſtudy Philoſophy and vain deceit, the works of <hi>Flato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle, Logick,</hi> (the art of Reaſon) <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> (the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:118899:19"/> art of well ſpeaking) and read Books of Moral Philoſophy, called <hi>Aethicks:</hi> and Divinity they ſtudy likewiſe, and mingle all together; and all this ſtuffe; <hi>viz. Logick, Rhetorick, Philoſophy, Divinity,</hi> the Languages of <hi>Latine, Greek,</hi> and <hi>Hebrew,</hi> that they have learned &amp; ſtudyed for, are called gifts fit for the Miniſtry, ſay the wiſe men of the world; but I ſay, That theſe things makes not the Vnive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And likewiſe in theſe Vniverſities are brought up yong men to be <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, Doctors of the Law, Maſters and Doctors of Muſick; Batchellors and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of Phyſick, Aſtrologers, Mathematicks,</hi> &amp;c. and theſe two Vniverſities are called the Eyes of the Nation, but they are both dark and blind ones; and they are called the two Fountains of Learning, but they are both ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Fountains, that no ſweet water iſſues; out of them, therefore it is high time to cleanſe them of their filth and abominations. And for their learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I am ſure there is as much wickedneſſe and ungodlineſſe learned and practiſed both by the Schollars and their Tutors and Governors, as by any other ſort of people, as you ſee in part before written.

Here by mans Laws the Vice-Chancellors receive their power and Authority to make Preachers, and for money do they admit men to preach: and for their gifts they pay men for, and for their admittance to preach they give money for; and for hire they preach, and for money they ſtudy and divine, and all that is done by the means of the two Vniverſities, which is an abomination to the Lord: for a corrupt fountain, cannot ſend forth at the ſame place both ſweet water and bitter: for I ſay, There is three ſorts of men, or four, that aſcends out of theſe two Fountains, <hi>viz. Cambridge</hi> and <hi>Oxford,</hi> and theſe four ſorts are all learned men, and men that are in high eſteem with the men of the world, and theſe are, the <hi>Lawyers,</hi> the <hi>Priests,</hi> called <hi>Miniſters,</hi> the <hi>Doctors of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks,</hi> and the <hi>Aſtrologers,</hi> which the world runs after a whoring, as after
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:118899:20"/> ſo many Idol-gods: for firſt, many people if they have loſt any thing, or have any thing ſtolne from them, then they run to the <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> to know where it is, and there goes one part of their money for caſting of a figure, and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a lye. Secondly, If they be ſick a little, then they run to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors for help, and not to God, for he is not in all the thoughts of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and ſo the Doctor he gets another ſum of money for his imaginary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections that profits not, but does hurt to the bodyes of men, women, and children. Thirdly, If any difference or quarrel befall amongſt men, then ſtraightwaies they run to ask counſel of a Lawyer, and ask not couſel of the Lord: and of the Counſellors, Lawyers, &amp;c. they take counſel to arreſt, and ſue one another at the Law, and they get another part of the peoples money. Fourthly, The people run generally after the Prieſts, who they call Miniſters, that preach to them for hire. and divine for money, thinking that by thoſe unprofitable talkers they ſhall be taught the way to heaven, and to them they pay tythes, and to them they give money, gifts, and rewards, and of them they are ever learning, but are never able to come to the knowledge of the truth, becauſe they are ſeduced by ſuch unprofitable talkers;<note place="margin">

               </note> and ſo the Prieſts take the peoples money for nought, and the people being ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by theſe unprofitable talkers, give their money for that which is not bread, whereas if they would come and learn of Chriſt, who is the true way, and the way to the Father, and the way to peace and reſt for their ſouls: he would lead them, and teach them, and feed them freely, without money and without price.</p>
            <p>Therefore I ſay to all people, So long as you follow the unprofitable tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, which you call <hi>Miniſters,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And again, leave of going to ask counſel of the <hi>Lawyers,</hi> neither do ye take counſel of them, for ſo long as ye take counſel of them, ye will never keep money in your purſe, nor your ſelves be at peace: Therefore I ſay peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, When there ariſeth any difference amongſt you, go and ask counſel of the Lord, and take counſel of the Lord what ye ſhall do therein, and the Lord God will lead you out of all ſtrife and contention, and teach you how to agree with your adverſaries quickly, and to love your neighbor as your ſelf, and to forgive your enemies, and to live in peace with all men: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay to all people, Ceaſe from the <hi>Lawyers,</hi> and follow the Lord whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who giveth to man every good thing.</p>
            <p>And again I ſay people, Ceaſe from the Doctors, for ſo long as ye follow them, ye will never enjoy your healths, and come to God who ſent his Word and healed the people, and delivered them from their deſtruction: Chriſt healed the woman of her Iſſue who had ſpent all that ſhe had, and had ſuffered many things of many Phyſicians, and was nothing bettered, but grew rather worſe. Therefore I ſay, Forſake the <hi>Phyſicians</hi> and come to Chriſt, who rebuked the Feaver, and it left <hi>Peters</hi> Wives Mother: God he wounds, and he heals: he kills, and makes alive: he brings down to the Grave, and raiſeth up again. But ſome it is very like may ſay, <hi>Muſt we not uſe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:118899:21"/> the means when we are ſick, and take ſomething to do us good?</hi> Yea: but I ſay, Wait with patience upon the Lord; ſtand in awe, and ſin not: and if the Lord command thee to go and take a Plaſter of Figs and lay to thy ſore, or to go and drink water,<note place="margin">2 <hi>King.</hi> 20.5, 6, 7. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Luke</hi> 17.19.</note> or waſh in the water and thou ſhalt be whole, then go in the name and in the fear of the Lord, and do as he commands; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in the Lord, ſo ſhalt thou be made whole. Now I ſay, That theſe three ſorts of men, [for I will put the Doctors and Aſtrologers together] the Prieſts, who are called <hi>Miniſters,</hi> the <hi>Lawyers,</hi> and <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> are all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the people like the <hi>Locuſts,</hi> the <hi>Caterpillar,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Palmor-worm,</hi> for all of them will have the peoples money, and what the one leaves, the other comes after and takes. And again, I ſay, That theſe learned men have been ever a generation of perſecutors of the people and ſervants of God; and the Scriptures doth teſtifie with me, that thoſe Prieſts that were made and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated by men, end the falſe Prophets, were in all generations perſecutors of the true Prophets and ſervants of the Lord, which he ſent forth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his Meſſages; and this I will prove both by Scripture and Hiſtory to be true.</p>

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:118899:21"/> carryed him away, and delivered him to <hi>Pilate,</hi> and would not ceaſe till they had got him crucified and put to death; for ſaid they, <hi>We have a Law,</hi>

And now I will inſtance one particular mans ſufferings; and that which they made his crime, was for ſetting up a certain Bill upon one of their falſly called Church doors, againſt the Popes pardons, in which Bill he named the Pope to be Antichriſt, for the which he was three ſeveral dayes whipped, and after that he was burned in the forehead (I would have Parliaments to take notice of this whipping and burning, and not do as the papiſts do) and for pulling down the Images, and breaking them to pieces, he was by the Canons, Prieſts, and Monks, &amp;c. judged and condemned, and by the Secular Powers, had his right hand cut off from his arm, and with a ſharp pair of pinſons they violently pull'd his Noſe off from his face, and his paps from his breaſts, and both his arms from his body, and afterward burned him in the fire.

            <p>Now here I obſerve that in the Scriptures [and in the heart] it is written that Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Swear not at all;</hi> and likewiſe that thoſe Miniſters that he ſent out to preach the Goſpel writ to the Brethren, ſaying, <hi>My Brethren, ſwear not, neither by heaven nor by earth, nor by any other oath,</hi> &amp;c. Now Chriſt that taught men they ſhould not ſweare at all, he was by the Scribes and Phariſees and the high Prieſts (who taught men to ſwear) counted a perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Nation, and was vehemently accuſed, and ſaid that they had a Law, and by that Law he ought to dye; and they did not ceaſe till that he was put to death. And <hi>Iames</hi> (he was by <hi>Herod</hi> ſlain with the ſword) who writ to the twelve ſcattered Tribes, ſaying, <hi>Above all things my brethren ſwear not,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>William Thorpe</hi> for denying to ſwear by a Book, at the Pope and his Adherents command was put in Priſon, wherein it was thought that he dyed. And now in theſe dayes ſome lye in priſon becauſe they will not ſwear at all.</p>
            <p>Now I ſuppoſe that none will be ſo impudent as to ſay that Chriſt and the Apoſtles were not guided by the ſpirit of truth, but that they will ſay on the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt and his Apoſtles were guided by the ſpirit of truth: Then I ſay thus, That the Scribes, Phariſees and the high Prieſts and the Pope and his Adherents, <hi>viz.</hi> the Rulers of the earth, the Biſhops and the Clergy, were and are all guided by a ſpirit of error; by which ſpirit of error the Scribes, Phariſees, chief Prieſts, the Pope and his Adherents, <hi>viz.</hi> the Biſhops and the Clergy, and the Rulers of the earth, taught men to ſwear, and do teach and compel men to ſwear by the ſame ſpirit of error. And again; The ſame ſpirit which Chriſt Jeſus and his Apoſtles taught men that they ſhould not ſwear at all, taught many of the Martyrs to deny ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Pope and his Adherents command: And the ſame ſpirit teacheth us [the people called Quakers] to deny ſwearing at all; for ſay we, It is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to obey God rather then man; and therefore we rather chooſe to ſuffer for the name of Chriſt then to obey man by ſwearing, contrary to the Law written in our hearts by the ſpirit; and by the power of the ſpirit of truth are we taught, and do deny the paying of tythes to the prieſts of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Foraſmuch as in our dayes we ſee danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous times are upon us by reaſon of burning of Warres, and taking away of our Riches, and the moſt cruel depredations of barbarous Enemies, and of the Paganiſh Nations waſting us; therefore I <hi>Ethelbald,</hi> King of the <hi>Eaſt-Saxons,</hi> with the Council of my Biſhops and Princes, have avouched it as wholeſom counſel, and an uniform remedy, That I grant an Hereditary Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Lands to God and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and all the Saints, by a perpetual right to be poſſeſſed, to wit, a part of my Land, that it may be ſecure and free from all ſecular ſervices and tributes to the King both great and ſmall, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taxes, which we call <hi>Witterden,</hi> and that it may be free from all things, for the remiſſion of our ſouls and of our ſins, to the ſerving of God only, without any expedition or building of a Bridge, or fortifying of a Tower, that ſo they may without ceaſing pour out prayers to God for us ſo much the more diligently, to the end that we leſſen their ſervitude in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:118899:29"/> of the earth have taken away from the people (and given to their Miniſters as their ſervants to preach them up) their Fields, their Vinyards, and their Olive-yards, even the beſt of them, and given them to their ſervants, and the tenth of the peoples ſheep, and the tenth of their ſeed, and of their vinyards, and given them to their Prieſts, Miniſters, and ſervants.

            </p>
            <p>But ſome it is like will ſay that the Kings gave their own lands to the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy:<note place="margin">

And did not <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror do the like? And did not the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings and <hi>William the Conqueror</hi> prove tyrants to the people and treacherous likewiſe? And one thing I do grant, that is this, That the Kings or Rulers of the earth may with the conſent of the people aſſembled in counſel, raiſe money for the publike good, that is, for the defence of the Nation, and for the preſervation of the Nations peace and welfare at home or abroad, by Land and Sea, and defence of the nations enemies. But I ſay again, That the Kings and Rulers of the earth ought not to take away the peoples Goods, or the Fruits of their labour, nor the increaſe of their ſeed, nor the increaſe of their Flock or Herd, or their Vinyard to give unto others, nor to ſell unto others,<note place="margin">

And again, The true Prophets, and Apoſtles, and Miniſters of the Goſpel that Chriſt ſent, they did not take tythes, nor gifts, nor rewards for preaching nor propheſying, for tythes was not the Goſpel that they liv'd by: But thoſe Miniſters that the Kings and Kulers of the earth, the Pope and his Adherents make and ſent forth, they take gifts, and rewards, and tythes for their preaching, therefore they commit ſin with greedineſſe, and do the thing that is not right in the ſight of God, for God did not require tythes to be paid to thoſe Miniſters that are made and ſent out by the Kings and Rulers of the earth, the Pope and his Adherents; but when God required tythes and firſt fruits to be paid, he required that the tythes and firſt fruits, ſhould be paid to the Levites, <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſons, [whom God did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly, God required firſt fruits and tythes to be paid in no other Land or Nation but in the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> only.</p>
            <p>Thirdly; That when the children of Iſral had poſſeſſion of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and that when they enjoyed peace round about them, then were they to pay firſt fruits and tythes, and not before</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That the tythes of the land [of <hi>Canaan</hi>] whether the ſeed of the land, or the fruit of the tree, the wine, the oyle, the encreaſe of the ſeed that the field bringeth forth yeer by yeer: the tythe of the Corn, and the tythe of the Flock, or of the Herd, the Lord God ſaid was his: and therefore ſaid the Lord, <hi>The firſt fruits of thy Land thou shalt bring unto the houſe of the Lord thy God:</hi> And again ſaid the Lord, <hi>Bring ye all the tythes into the Store-hovſe, that there may be meat in my houſe:</hi> and they that brought not in their tythes to that Store-Houſe were curſed with a curſe, for they had robbed God of their tythes and offerings, even that whole Nation had done it.</p>

            <p>Seventhly, That to the ſons of <hi>Levi</hi> (who received the office of the Prieſthood) for their ſervice which they ſerved, even the ſervice of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of the Congregation, did God give the firſt fruits and tythes unto for their maintenance, and likewiſe the fatherleſs, the widow and the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that came within the gates was to eat thereof, and be ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, God commanded the eleven tribes of Iſrael to pay tythes to the ſons of <hi>Levi</hi> who received the office of the Prieſthood, and to no other Prieſthood did he require tythes to be paid unto ſince the reſurrection of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, That the firſt fruits and tythes were by a law that came by <hi>Moſes</hi> due unto <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſons the <hi>Levites</hi> (whom God had choſen, and not man, to miniſter before him at the Altar, and to do the ſervice of the

               <hi>This is Ieſus who was called of God, and not of man, nor after the law of a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal commandment was he made an high Prieſt, but after the power of an endleſſe life he was made an High-Prieſt for ever after the order of Melchiſedec, and continueth for ever an unchangeable Prieſthood; forſech an High-Prieſt it became us to have, who is holy, harmleſſe, undefiled, ſeparate from ſinners, and made higher then the heavens: but by the Law by which the Levitical Prieſthood came, were many prieſts which had infirmities, which continued not by reaſon of death, and ſo it paſſed from one to another; which Prieſthood being imperfect in it ſelf, perfected not any; for he offered up Sacrifices daylie year by year; firſt for himſelf,</hi> viz. <hi>for his own ſins, &amp; then for the errors of the people: which ſacrifices were year by year offered up continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, but the comers thereunto could never be made perfect: for if therefore perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction had been by the levitical Prieſthood, then what further need was there that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Priest should ariſe after the order of Melchiſedec, and not be called af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the order of Aaron: but perfection came not by the Levitical Prieſthood; for their ſacrifices that they offered up year by year made not the commers thereunto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: therefore there was a neceſsity that another should come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But God ſo loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Son, who gloryfied not himſelf to be made an High-Prieſt, but was gloryfied of his Father, who ſaid unto him, Thou are my Son, to day have I begotten thee; thou art a Prieſt for ever after the order of Melchiſedec: and he was not only called a Prieſt for ever, but he was called of God an high Priest likewiſe after the order of Melchiſedec: And Christ Ieſus the Son of God came having compaſsion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way: and though he were a Son, yet he learned obedience by the things which he ſuffered; and being made perfect he became the author of eternal ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation unto all them that obey him, and hath obtained eternal redemption for us by his own blood: for by one offering of the holy of Ieſus once for all, he offered one
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:118899:32"/> ſacrifice for ſins for ever, and by that one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified.</hi> So that now ye may plainly ſee that the Levitical Prieſthood who came by the law to do the ſervice of the Tabernacle of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to offer up both gifts and ſacrifices for their own ſins, and likewiſe for the errors of the people, is changed into a more better and perfect then was before, which changeth not, but abideth for ever. Therefore ſeeing that the ſons of <hi>Levi,</hi> who received the office of the Prieſthood according to the Law (had a commandment to take tythes) were diſcharged from their office, and their ſervice put to an end by that one offering of the body of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> once for all; <hi>for by that one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified:</hi> ſo that where there is remiſſion for ſin, there is no more offering for ſin. Now ſeeing that it is ſo plain that by the ſons of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi</hi> [the <hi>Levitical</hi> Prieſthood] perfection came not, therefore that prieſthood was changed, and the ſons of <hi>Levi</hi> diſcharged of their ſervice by <hi>Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, who offered himſelf a ſacrifice once for all, and that by him perfection came for ever to them that are ſanctified by that one offering: Therefore there was a neceſsity that a change of the Law should be made alſo by reaſon of its ſervitude that lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the people, and likewiſe for the unprofitableneſſe thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The children of Iſrael were by the law commanded to pay firſt fruits and tythes for the maintenance of the levitical prieſthood: <hi>And the ſons of Levi who received the office of che Priesthood, had a commandment to take tythes of their Brethren according to the law, and of no other Nation or people were they to receive any firſt fruits or tythes: but verily that commandment is diſanulled, and the law is changed by our King, our Law-giver, and our Iudge and Prophet, and Prieſt for ever,</hi> viz. <hi>Chriſt Ieſus, who having abolished in his Flesh the enmity, even the law ef commandments contained in Ordinances, and hath blotted out the hand-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Ordinances that was againſt us, and contrary to us, which was a yoake of bondage upon the neck of the Diſciples: he took it and nailed to his croſs, try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing over them in himſelf, and ſaid, It is finished, for he is the end of the law for righteeuſneſſe to every one that believeth in him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

And ſaid <hi>Paul, Not many wiſe men after the flesh, nor many mighty, nor many Nobles are called: even ſuch as believe not in Chriſt Ieſus, will not that he should reign over them, therefore they have made unrighteous, unjuſt and unholy laws for to require people to pay tythes to the prieſts and miniſters which they themſelves have ſo ordained, conſecrated and ſent forth, and not God:</hi> And the Prieſts and Miniſters who are not ordained, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated, nor ſent forth of God, but by man; even they by their unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, unholy, and the unjuſt laws of men they take tythes, and ſue men at the unrighteous law for tythes, and cauſe men to be put in priſon by the unjuſt law for tythes, and by the unholy law they take trebble damages of mens goods for non-payment of tythes; thus contradicting what Chriſt Jeſus hath done: for Chriſt the true King and the juſt and righteous Lawgiver he diſannulled the law,<note place="margin">

            <p>Therefore I ſay, That the Kings and Rulers of the earth, the Pope and his Adherents, who have made laws to pay and to take tythes by, they are ſuch
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:118899:32"/> as believe not in Chriſt Jeſus the Son of God; for had they believed on Chriſt Jeſus the Son of God, they would have owned him to have been a King and a Law-giver unto them; and likewiſe they would that he ſhould have reigned over them as King; and had they loved him,<note place="margin">

I ſay again, That there was no more tythes nor firſt fruits to be paid; and all they that refuſed to pay tythes and firſt fruits after that time of reformation which was made by Chriſt Jeſus (who offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one ſacrifice for ſins for ever, and after he had ſo done,<note place="margin">
